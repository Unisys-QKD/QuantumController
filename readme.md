## Problem Statement:

The rapid advancement of quantum computing threatens the security of traditional cryptographic methods, necessitating the integration of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) into network architectures. However, challenges such as the lack of standardized integration frameworks, complexities in accessing quantum hardware, and the need for dynamic network management hinder the seamless incorporation of QKD into Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Ensuring security, resilience, scalability, and interoperability in QKD-enabled networks remains a critical challenge that requires a comprehensive solution.

## Quantum Key Distribution (QKD):

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys between two parties, typically referred to as Alice and Bob, by utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics.

## Our Idea:

The Quantum-Enhanced Software-Defined Networking (QSDN) project aims to develop a robust SDN controller with integrated Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) functionalities. The Quantum Controller will dynamically integrate QKD capabilities, ensuring secure key distribution and effective network flow management. This project lays the foundation for a resilient and adaptable networking paradigm capable of addressing the imminent threat posed by quantum computing while promising secure and efficient data transmission in the future.

## Architecture Overview:

1. **Quantum Layer:**
   - Responsible for the management and distribution of cryptographic keys generated by the Quantum Layer.
   - Ensures the secure transmission of quantum keys over the network.

2. **Key Management Layer:**
   - Implements protocols and mechanisms for key distribution, synchronization, and storage.
   - Ensures the availability of secure keys for network encryption and authentication.

3. **Controller Layer:**
   - Orchestrates network operations, including routing control, access control, policy enforcement, and error detection.
   - Dynamically integrates QKD functionalities into the network, facilitating secure communication and efficient network flow management.

4. **Management Layer:**
   - Provides overarching management and monitoring capabilities for the QSDN architecture.
   - Ensures the scalability, resilience, and reliability of the QSDN infrastructure.

## Implementation:

### Controller (Ryu):
- Setup new quantum functions for establishing quantum channels within the SDN network.
- Integration of classical functions to complement quantum functionalities.
- Development of custom Ryu modules to handle quantum-specific operations and interactions with other network components.

### Mininet Setup:
- Configuration of Mininet environment to emulate network topologies and test SDN functionalities.
- Deployment of custom QKD nodes within Mininet to simulate quantum-enabled network devices.

### Tornado For Integration:
- Utilization of Tornado framework to develop RESTful APIs for interaction between the SDN controller and external applications.
- Implementation of backend logic to handle requests and responses related to quantum key distribution, network configuration, and management.

### OpenFlow Protocol:
- Implementation of OpenFlow protocol to facilitate communication between the SDN controller and network switches.
- Programming of flow tables to define packet forwarding and routing behavior based on quantum channel establishment and management.

### Test Emulator:
- Using QuNetSim emulator with self-static variables to mimic real QKD devices.
- Integration of the emulator with Mininet for comprehensive network testing and evaluation.
- Development of Tornado applications within Mininet to facilitate interaction with the QKD node emulator and SDN controller.

## Future Goals:

- Implementing major controller functions handling for a QKD network.
- Enhancing network security through Access Control function.
- Implementing Policy-Based Control to ensure consistent application of policies across the network.

## tech-stack

### Ryu:
- Component-based software-defined networking (SDN) framework written in Python.
- Provides a library for implementing SDN controllers using the OpenFlow protocol.
- `Ryu_controller.py` file utilizes Ryu to create a custom application implementing basic OpenFlow functionalities.



### Tornado:
- Python web framework and asynchronous networking library.
- Well-suited for building high-performance, non-blocking web servers and applications.
- `App1.py` file uses Tornado to create a simple web application responding with "Hello, world" to HTTP requests.


### Mininet:
- Network emulator used for creating virtual networks for testing SDN applications.
- Allows creating realistic network topologies using lightweight virtualization techniques.
- `mininet_setup.py` file sets up a custom network topology using Mininet, creating switches, hosts, and establishing links between them.


### OpenFlow Protocol:
- Communication protocol enabling control of forwarding behavior of network devices (e.g., switches, routers) by external controllers.
- Utilized by Ryu and Mininet for communication between the controller and switches in the network.

### Python:
- Versatile programming language extensively used in the project.
- Utilized for implementing SDN applications, web servers, and network automation scripts.
- All provided files (`Ryu_controller.py`, `App1.py`, `Simple_switchex.py`, `mininet_setup.py`) are written in Python.
